        <h1>Honest Energy</h1>
        <p>
          The average american household releases <strong>13,000 pounds
          of CO<sub>2</sub></strong> into the atmosphere each year.
          Thatâ€™s enough CO<sub>2</sub> to fill over 120 school buses.</p>
        <p>
          You can turn 13,000 pounds to zero by switching to clean energy.
          And you can do it today. Switching is easy, and we can help guide
          you through that process. All it takes is a few clicks.
